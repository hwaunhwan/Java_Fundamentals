Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?
Parent called
Child called
Because both default constructors are called when the object c was instantiated in the parent then child order.



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
